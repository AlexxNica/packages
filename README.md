# FireHOL packages

This repository is intended to provide pre-built packages for distributions
that do not have them as standard.

It is something of a best-effort basis, so pull requests to add new
packaging formats or update the versions packaged are always welcome.

Everything gets built by Travis-CI; tags are created after a package
update or new output is added which automatically puts all the
binaries into github releases.
